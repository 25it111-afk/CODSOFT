# Sales Prediction Using Python

## Objective
To predict product sales based on advertising expenditure using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
A sample advertising dataset containing the following features:
- TV advertising budget
- Radio advertising budget
- Newspaper advertising budget
- Sales (target variable)

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Methodology
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Split data into training and testing sets
3. Built a Linear Regression model
4. Evaluated the model using Mean Squared Error and R2 Score
5. Visualized Actual vs Predicted Sales

## Outcome
The Linear Regression model successfully predicts sales based on advertising
spend and provides a clear visualization of prediction accuracy.
